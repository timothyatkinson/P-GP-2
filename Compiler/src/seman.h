/* GLib's hashtable data structure is used to implement GP2's symbol table.
 * GP2 identifiers are the keys. The values are lists of struct Symbols,
 * defined in the symbol module. 
 *
 * The following glib function calls are used extensively in the source file. 
 *
 * ===============================================
 * GSList *list = g_hash_table_lookup(table, key);
 * ===============================================
 *
 * Creates a pointer to a GSList by calling g_hash_table_lookup. This function 
 * looks up a name in the symbol table and returns a pointer to the identifier
 * list if the name is already present, otherwise it returns NULL. 
 * Note that g_hash_table_lookup returns a void pointer.
 *
 * =====================================
 * list = g_slist_prepend(list, symbol);     
 * =====================================    
 *
 * Adds the symbol given by the second argument to the start of the GSList
 * list. If list is NULL then a new list is created with the single element
 * symbol.
 *
 * =======================================
 * g_hash_table_replace(table, key, list); 
 * =======================================
 *
 * Inserts the GSList list to the symbol table. If the key already exists 
 * then the old value for that key is freed with <value_destroy_func> and 
 * replaced with the new value. This means that only one symbol list will 
 * exist for a particular key.
 *
 * These three function calls are made in succession to ensure that the
 * symbol list for a particular identifier name always contains all the 
 * objects with that name.
