  Generate Rule Module
  ====================

  Module for generating code to apply a rule. The functions in this module
  take a rule and produce a C module with two principal functions: one to match
  the rule (creating a morphism) and one that takes a morphism and applies the
  rule.

/* The functions in this module use a static searchplan of the LHS of a rule
 * to generate matching code. Each searchplan operation has a function that
 * emits a C function to match its rule item to a compatible host graph item
 * at runtime. The structure of the complete C source file is described below.
 *
 * For a searchplan op_1,...,op_n and corresponding generated C functions
 * f_1,...,f_n, the main matching function match_R calls f_1. If f_i
 * finds a match, it updates the appropriate data structures and calls f_i+1.
 * If f_i doesn't find a match, it returns false and the previous matcher handles
 * that result by either testing another host graph item or by backtracking, namely
 * undoing data structure updates from a previous match. If the first matching
 * function f_1 returns false, then match_R returns false, signalling that the 
 * rule matching failed. If the last matching function f_n finds a match, then
 * it returns true. This propagates back through all the matching functions to 
 * match_R, which returns true, signalling that the rule match is a success. */

 *
 * generateAddRHSCode is called when the LHS is the empty graph. The generated
 * function does not take the morphism as an argument, as that is not needed to
 * add the RHS to the host graph.
 *
 * generateApplicationCode is called when both the LHS and the RHS are not the 
 * empty graph. It generates full rule application code, including the evaluation
 * of RHS labels, supported by the RHS label generation functions in the genLabel
