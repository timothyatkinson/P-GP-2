/* GP2 symbols are stored in struct Symbol. These are values of the symbol
 * table. The hash key of each symbol is its name in the GP2 program text.
 *
 * GP2's symbols are:
 * - Procedures
 * - Rules
 * - Variables
 * - Nodes
 * - Edges
 *
 * The Symbol structure contains the following:
 *
 * Type: A variable symbol's type is the variable's GP2 type according to its 
 *       declaration in a rule. The type of a node or edge is determined by 
 *       which side of the rule it occurs in. This is required for semantic
 *       analysis.
 *
 * Scope: The procedure in which the symbol is visible. Either "Main" or the
 *        name of a procedure in the program. All symbols have a scope.
 *
 * Rule Name: The rule in which the symbol is visible. NULL for symbols of type
 *            'rule' and 'procedure'. This field is used to uniquely identify
 *            variables, nodes and edges as they can have the same name in
 *            different rules.
 *       
 * Flags: is_var is set to true if the symbol represents a GP variable. This
 *        is for more concise code: better to compare to a single bool than to
 *        compare with each of the individual variable types.
 *
 *        in_lhs is set to true if the symbol has type variable and occurs in
 *        the LHS of a rule. Set to false in all other cases. 
 * 
 *        wildcard is set to true if the symbol is a node or edge with the cyan
 *        mark. Set to false in all other cases.
 *
 *        bidirectional is set to true if the symbol is a bidirectional edge.
 *        Set to false in all other cases.
